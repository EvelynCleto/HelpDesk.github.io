# Help-Desk

Welcome to the Help-Desk project!

This project consists of a web-based help desk application developed using XAMPP and PHP. The application is designed to facilitate the management of support tickets and provide a platform for users to submit their queries or issues.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

- `xampp/`: Contains the XAMPP installation files and configuration.
- `app_help_desk/`: Contains the web application files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Help-Desk project, follow these steps:

1. Install XAMPP on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

2. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. Move the `app_help_desk` folder to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. The exact path may vary depending on your operating system. For example, on Windows, it could be `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

4. Start the Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP.

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/app_help_desk/`. This will launch the Help-Desk application.

6. You can now use the application to manage support tickets, submit queries, and track issue resolutions.
